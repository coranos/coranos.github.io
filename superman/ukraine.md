[A middle aged Clark Kent and Joe Biden in the white house]

  Joe: Russia has invaded Ukraine. Superman, what can we do?

  Superman: If I help Ukraine, Dr Manhattan will delete all of us. I don't know what to do. I can fly Mr. Zelinskyy out of there, if he wants.

[Mr. Zelinskyy in his office in Kyiv, Joe Biden on the phone. Zelinskyy is clean shaven, whit shirt, black coat, no tie]

  Joe (on the phone): Superman can fly you and your family out of there.

  Zelinskyy: Are you serious? No. The fight is here. I need antitank weapons, not a ride.

[Mr. Zelinskyy in his office in Kyiv, Joe Biden on the phone. Zelinskyy has a beard, green t-shirt]

  Joe (on the phone): Superman says we cannot help, Dr. Manhattan will kill us all if he joins the fight.

  Zelinskyy: I understand. So far, we are holding. Thank you, but I have other calls to make. If there is a number of dead Ukranians that needs to be met before you will help us, let me know, and I will call you back.

[A middle aged woman in Ukranian colors prays to a Theotokos icon on a table. There is a bag of sunflower seeds on the table as well. A Smerch rocket booster section is there. It had already broken through the ceiling into the shrine where she prays.]

  Woman: Mother Mary, help us. St Michael the Archangel, protect us. St Jeremiah, hear my prayer as you heard Judas Maccabees.

[St Jeremiah appears to the Ukranian woman, stretching out his right hand, and touching the smerch booster]

  Jeremiah: Take this holy Javelin, a gift from God, with which you will strike down your adversaries.

[The smerch is now a Javelin ATGM. The woman takes the Javelin, and poses like St Javelin of Ukraine. The bag of sunflower seeds falls to the ground.]

  St Javelin: Thank you. It is not by arms, but as the Lord decides. He gives victory to those who deserve it.

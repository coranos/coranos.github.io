  <h1>Why is camo useful?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you want to hold ten million banano, but not show up on the rich list?</li>
    <li>Do you want to be able to send someone a million banano, but not show up on a whale watch?</li>
    <li>Do you want to be able to dump a million banano on an exchange, and not be yelled at for tanking the price?</li>
    <li>Do you want to be able to hold funds in a shared account (both parties can spend) withount sharing the seed?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Then camo may be for you!</h2>
  <p>Camo is a second layer, built on top of banano.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It uses on-chain shared secrets to store a seed on-chain.</li>
    <li>It uses seed based fund storage, rather than account based fund storage, to split a large account into smaller amounts.</li>
    <li>It uses seed based fund transfers, rather than account based fund transfers, to split a large transfer into smaller amounts.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How do I use camo?</h2>
  <h3>Account Setup</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>You need to start with a seed. save this seed someplace safe.</li>
    <li>Put the seed into the manual camo site to get a 'camo account'
      <a target="_blank" href="camo.html">Manual Camo</a></li>
    <li>Go to bananovault, enter the seed, and set the account's representative to your 'camo account'.
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vault.banano.cc/">Banano Vault</a></li>
    <li>Enter the camo account into Manual Camo, and get the Shared Secret.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You now have a secret seed, the 'shared secret' from Manual Camo.
    You can use that seed in bananovault, and don't have it written down anywhere!</p>
  <p>
    As long as the camo site is up, you can use the starter seed to derive the shared secret.</p>
  <p>Then use the shared secret as your seed in the vault.</p>
  <h3>Using the Shared Secret To Hold Funds</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter your shared secret into bananovault as a seed.
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vault.banano.cc/">Banano Vault</a></li>
    <li>Create 20 accounts under that seed.</li>
    <li>Fill each account with 500,000 banano. Slowly if you want. No hurry.<br>
      If you fill everything at once, you are vulnerable to a timing attack.<br>
      Fill slowly, like many impoverished peasants instead of one big rich guy.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You now have ten million banano, but do not show up on the rich list.</p>
  <h3>Using the Shared Secret To Send Funds</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Have a friend set up their account as a camo account.</li>
    <li>Look up the representative of your friend's account, and put it into Manual Camo with your own seed.
      <a target="_blank" href="camo.html">Manual Camo</a></li>
    <li>You now have a shared secret that both you and your friend know, and both can use as a seed.</li>
    <li>Create 20 accounts under that seed.</li>
    <li>Fill each account with 50,000 banano. Slowly if you want. No hurry.<br>
      If you fill everything at once, you are vulnerable to a timing attack.<br>
      Fill slowly, like many small minnows instead of one big whale.</li>
    <li>Tell your friend.</li>
    <li>Your friend can now use his seed and your representative to get the shared seed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You have now sent ten million banano, but do not show up on a whale watch.</p>
  <p>Both of you can spend from the accounts, but neither of you needs to save the seed.</p>
  <p>If your friend owns an exchange, and the account he set up was a exchange account, you can dump the bans and nobody knows it was you.</p>

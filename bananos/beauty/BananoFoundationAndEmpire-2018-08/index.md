| 4      | @ ComeBananaTeam Lider de Kasanay#7801|![04-id]  | Four years ago, while working online I thought of opening a grocery store and food in my neighborhood. I have done this, and it is successful. In this store you teach people how to earn crypto coins, and they can pay for their groceries in crypto coins. We can charge mobile phones, convert to local currency. Anyone can come and earn money. I now own a cafe that does all these things, but we use bolivars, which devalue every day. I would like to use nano and banano instead, as it is more stable currency. I need (one million bananos) to do the conversion from a bolivar economy to a banano economy. I would use this money to convert everyone's bolivars to bananos so we can perform economic activity using only bananos, as a mini banano republic. | |  1,000,000 BAN |

| 19    |@ Mayrapina#9547                        |![19-id] | My idea is to plant different types of vegetables and fruits on the other hand raise egg-laying hens. This land is unused and to be honest with the situation as this would be both a means of production and a humanitarian aid because in my country food is so expensive that we could in the future supply fruit shops and sell eggs at a lower value thus helping others to obtain such food as well as eventualities such as '' sopazos '' that are sponsored by the Banana Coin currency through this project. I started testing the land only without resources it costs a lot since only with my daughter does not give me much time to herd the floor and that maintenance that could be given as work to some people who need it on the other hand I emphasize again that I have knowledge in this of agriculture and I know that it is an excellent idea since we are talking about that if it is done we can produce this same production for others and help that is the value that characterizes us | 35000 BAN |

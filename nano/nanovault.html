<h2 id="ledger-status">Your Ledger Status</h2>
<p>On the left navigation you can find the current status of your Ledger device.  When it is not connected, you will be unable to sign any new transactions or add new accounts.  If the device status seems wrong, you can click on it to attempt to reconnect to the Ledger device.  Your Ledger will only be marked as ready when it is unlocked and the Nano application is open.</p>

<p>Once your ledger wallet is imported, you can use the &#8216;Accounts&#8217; page to view the current status of all your Nano accounts.  By clicking on one of your accounts, you can view the full details including transaction history.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-transactions">Receiving Transactions</h2>
<p>By default, NanoVault will attempt to receive incoming transactions automatically.  This means that when leaving the wallet open, or re-opening it, pending transactions will be sent to your Ledger device for confirmation as soon as possible.  Most of the time, you should not have to worry about manually receiving a transaction, but if you do, you can use the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the &#8216;Receive&#8217; page from the left navigation. (This page only appears when you have pending transactions)</li>
<li>Press the &#8216;Receive&#8217; button on the transaction you want to approve.  This will trigger a confirmation on your Ledger device.</li>
<li>On your Ledger device, ensure that the transaction information looks correct, then use the buttons on your Ledger device to confirm or deny the transaction.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that information, you are ready to store Nano with your Ledger Device and access it easily at any time using NanoVault!  Besides just supporting Ledger devices, NanoVault also adds in lots of helpful features such as local currency values, a fully integrated address book, and more which make sending and receiving Nano simple and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h1>
<p>NanoVault does not store any information about you on a server.  The only information stored is in your local browser storage which allows you to use your wallet more easily on subsequent visits.  With a Ledger device, the only information stored is your public account addresses, since that is the only information exposed by the Ledger device.</p>

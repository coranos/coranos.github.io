# Life Goes On

## Closer to Delivery

We went outside our home for a while.
It's dusty and not much to see. 
We stood next to the wall and watched the drones fly by.
She tried to wear her heavy red winter coat since it was getting chilly outside, but it didn't fit, the zipper wouldn't close!
So she wore a heavy sweater underneath instead.

## A Memory Of The Past

My wife and I shared some memories as we were waiting for the new baby to come into our lives.
One of them was on our honeymoon.
I remember looking back at her as we were walking away from the beach and she sat down to rest near the ocean.

She looked so beautiful, the memory has stuck in my mind these many years.

## The Future Arrives

The day after our baby arrived, my wife and my daughter slept the whole day.

She woke up every four hours to breast feed, but the milk wasn't coming.
The doctor said it could take up to three days for her breasts to produce milk!
So meanwhile I'm going to the store and getting formula.
It's expensive, about 10x as expensive as milk, and it comes in 3oz bottles.
My daughter will sometimes eat 3oz, sometimes only 1/2 oz. 

My daughter wakes up every 2-4 hours as well, cries, and then once we figure out what she needs she goes back to sleep.
There's no way to tell, so you just have to check: 
Check if she's wet, check if she's poopy, check if she's hungry, check if she's bored.
If it's none of those, she's jsut crying for no reason.

One time we were both exhausted and my daughter wouldn't stop crying, so I said to my wife 'Sometimes you can just let her cry, and she'll cry herself to sleep'. That was the wrong thing to say. I got a really dark look from my wife, that I had never seen before.

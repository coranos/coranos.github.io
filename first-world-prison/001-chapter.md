# Introduction

## A Truck in the Desert

The whole land around our home is a red desert, and the water I see outside is brown. Everything comes in by truck.

Small unmanned aircraft fly everywhere and monitor the traffic coming in and out.

You can make a few credits by looking at the video streams and pointing out anything valuable you see. I made 1 credit for pointing out the ball in this photo.

I drew this photo from memory with crayons. They don't let you own cameras.

The ball was gone the next time, so I assumed someone took it and sold it for 2 credits. I don't know even where it was, they don't tell you where the video stream comes from.

## A Prison in the Desert

This is what our home looks like, the desert colored half-pyramid with blue slit windows. The trucks are actually smaller than I could draw, they drive into an opening about 20 feet tall in the base of the pyramid. I got lucky, usually the drones are not flying this high up.

There was some kind of gathering of people at the north gate. The sun was setting behind them, so I guess the top of the image is west and it was evening. I made 1 credit by pointing out the crowd at the top and then the video stopped playing about five minutes later. This happens some times. You see a high value object, or people, and the video cuts out. I get assigned a different video a few seconds later.

It's unusual to see people outside, it really puts into persepective how big our home is. The fence is about 20 feet tall, and the pyramid maybe 1000 feet tall and 200 feet wide. The perimeter fence is around 1000 feet from end to end.

I could see several drones flying, so i drew four of them, one from the side and one from the top, and two as they looked when they were parked on top of our home. There were many more drones parked on the top. I could see at least 16 in four rows of four.

Our home has a perimeter fence, and the top left green area is farmland. The rest is desert. I'm pretty sure we were a prison for criminals some time in the past. I was born here.

## Our Home

This is what our home looks like. There's a window, and a window box of cherry tomatoes. The bed is there with my wife sleeping.

The door to our home would actually be behind me in this drawing, so I drew it in the upper left.

The bath is in the lower left, there's just a lip to keep the water there. The floor gets wet sometimes if we aren't careful.

I can make 1 credit for 10 cherry tomatoes, and the 5 plants make about 10 cherry tomatoes a week, which is a good steady income.

The window isn't really a window as it's frosted glass, and I know we are not on the outside because I can walk behind our home using the hallways outside our door.

## Our Hallway

This is the hallway outside our home. There is a blue line leading from each door to the center of the hallway. The blue line leads to the elevator, and there's a textured blue line that leads past the elevator, to the left of it, and on to the subway.

I can walk around freely, and the elevator doors open after a while if I stand there. The elevator then asks me "Coranos, work, home, or store?" and takes me where I say. Store is below home and work is above home. I go to the store to sell the tomatoes and buy stuff, and I go to work to do the video monitoring I described before.

## Our Subway

This is the subway, it's about five doors down from the elevator. The line going to the left in this drawing is the same line going to the right in the hallway drawing.

I have watched the subway come and go several times, but the doors have never opened for me to get on, and the subway never asked me any questions.

The ceiling is red brick, and the doors and walls are transparent. The doors have green arrows on them, and the walls have red circles with cross outs, indicating you cannot walk through there.

The textured blue line leads to the doors as well, and the yellow caution hashes are there so I'm positive they open for someone, even if it isn't me.

## Our Store

This is the store below my home. You can see my tomatoes for sale in the front row! The store sells rice, bread (sliced and whole), sliced meats, sliced cheese, and corn. It also has a small selection of housewares, like chairs, beds, pots and pans, silverware, and small appliances.

Every time I come into the store the cash register displays a negative number. When you buy something the number goes further negative, and when you sell something it goes closer to positive. Today it was at -50, so in a few weeks if I have good luck, it will become positive.

I have no idea what that means, the store clerk said when he buys something he's in the negative thousands and going lower so he has no idea either.

## Our Elevator

Today I shared an elevator with a Full Cyborg. There aren't many around, but there are some. There are both Robots and Cyborgs. You can be a partial Cyborg with one leg or one arm being robotic, or a Full Cyborg where everything you can see is metal.

This guy looked like a robot, but I can tell he was a man inside. It's how they look at people. A robot will look at you, nod, and look away. They may even smile and say hello. A cyborg will look at you, nod, and may even smile and say hello just like a robot. The difference is in their eyes. Their gaze lingers a bit on your arms and hands, and sometimes your feet. They were once human, and I can tell a part of them wishes they could be human again.

Sure a full cyborg is nearly indestructible, never gets cancer, lives long, and only dies when their brain can no longer process the senses, dementia sets in and they have to be turned off or become a danger to others. Even with all that, I can tell every one of them would give all they have to feel the wind in their hair one more time.

That's me on the left. He was really eager to go somewhere, stepped right up to the closed door and walked right in when it opened. I followed right after and we both went to the same floor, so not sure what the rush was.

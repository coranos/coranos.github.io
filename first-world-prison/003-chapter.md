### Guardian Angel

## Dying Aunt

I found out my aunt had fainted at her home and was in the hospital, so we went to visit her.
Our home is large, but it has good transportation. The subway answered to my request, and took us to our destination.

The doctor said my aunt needed a replacement arm, she had been outdoors for too long, and her arm had cancer.

If the replacement went well, she would be out in a week or so.
Even if it didn't go well or the cancer had spread, they had options available to make her fully cybernetic.
She could become a full cyborg with no exterior human parts, just a human brain, and a metal body.

## Whole Again

So the doctors came back, and said that she was not well enough for a full cybernetic conversion.
They thought it was best instead that they remove all the cybernetics, and make her human again.

They had stored all her appendages in cold storage. 
When they removed all the robotic parts, it was easy to reattach her arms and legs.

She looked very happy, and said she was grateful for whatever the doctors could do.

## Robot Angels

Afterwards the technicians took the equipment, now owned by the state, and attached it to a rocket pack and wings.
A robot now wears my aunt's old arm and legs.

They say when you die your soul goes to heaven and becomes an angel, where your body remains here on earth.
From dust you were created, and to dust you will return.

What you make stays here, as long as someone remembers who you were.

What the state gives you is returned to the state and given to someone else.

I only hope this guardian angel puts the equipment to good use.

# The House In The Jungle

## Flying to the Jungle

After a few months, I went back to work. My job was still to fly a drone around and look for things of value.

As you know, there is a desert around my home for several kilometers in every direction. There is no water, and very few plants grow there. I've flown over that desert for twenty years now and it gets boring, though you still find fresh things in the dust.

One day there were no storms, and the sky looked clear, so I took a chance and flew farther out, past the desert into the jungle.

## The Lady in the Jungle and her Children

I was flying over the jungle when I saw a house in a clearing, and a lady sleeping on top of her house!

I'd neer seen that before. Most people live inside, and never go on the roof except for repairs.

She waved at my drone, which meant she was familliar with us. I flew down to say hello. 

I saw her children were playing in the jungle nearby.

## Bartering

I have a camera, speaker, and microphone on the drone, so I said hello. She said "Hola!" back, so I knew she spoke Spanish. I speak a little, but the translator can speak a lot.

She said "Bones! Brother, If I'm ready bananas." Which means something like "I feel lucky, and I'm not sure if I'm ready, but I want something with bananas". She had no bananas with her, so I assumed she wanted to trade for food.

"What do you have for trade?" I asked. I hoped the translator got the translation right.

"I have nothing." She said. I wasn't sure what she wanted to trade then. I figured I'd stick around and try to reason it out.

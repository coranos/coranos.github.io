## The Storm

Today I was out scouting, and saw a storm coming in. There must have been some fighting going on, because this storm was different. It interfered with the drones. You could see the video glitch out as it got closer, and the drone stopped responding to commands. Mine glitched and crashed, so I set the rescue beacon to blink my id (Coranos). If it gets returned, they'll clean it and return it to service, and I'll get a few credits.

The lightning started fires in the crops, but that won't matter, none of the crops will be edible until they are cleaned anyways. Glitch storms have radioactive fallout in them, so if you eat the cops without cleaning them you'll get poisoned.

My tomatoes will sell really well this week.

You can see our home on the right, and some red trucks racing the storm on the orange road.

In the distance is Oiltown, the nearest place to our house. I've never been there but I've flown over it many times. It's an oil refinery, and a town built around the refinery and support structure. It's not as protected as our home, so they come to us after storms like this if anyone gets sick.

Those truck drivers will be sick for sure, but unless it's acute poisoning they'll be fine. The goods they carry will more than pay for their cancer treatment, otherwise they'd never have braved the storm.

## Store Empty

As I expected, the local store was out of nearly everything. Someone had brought some gas masks and sold them at the store, so I traded a cup of cherry tomatoes for one of them.

I've never been outside our home before, but the mask was so cheap I figured why not? I'll get it tested later, to make sure it works properly.

I was also now positive 100 credits, being in negative credits all my life, so I met that goal.

## New Place

The day after I had a positive credit balance, I was given the choice to move to a new apartment!

We moved a few days later, and it is much bigger than the old one.

Also, as you can tell from the baby fence and stroller, we are now expecting :)

We've tried for years. The doctors said nothing was wrong with us, to just keep trying. Now in the same month I have a positive net worth, a new house, and a new baby on the way!

The water tastes different here though, more bland, and less minty.
I kind of miss the minty taste, but the plants seem to like it plain.

I hung the gas mask on the wall in the kitchen.

## Lost Job

And just like that that the world changes on you. I went back to my job and they said I was no longer needed. I was the worst at the job of all the people there.

I guess it's back to selling tomatoes. But I'm good at flying, so I'm sure something will come by soon. I hope my wife isn't mad at me, I know we are expecting a baby soon, and it's not good to lose your job. But I had no warning, I had no idea it would happen.

## New Job

It looks like It wasn't too hard to get a new job, flying drones the same as before, only this time it's a little different.

Before I'd go and scout transport routes to see if anything was left behind. This time I'm scouting out settlements where there weren't any settlements before.

The military of my home don't like having any settlements nearby, they say it causes trouble. My job is to now look for settlements within the exclusion zone, and report them.

They pop up really quickly, showing up within a night. I've already found a few, one even had a full house and a guard tower set up, in one night.

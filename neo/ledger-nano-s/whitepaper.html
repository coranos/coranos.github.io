<title>NEO Ledger Nano S Whitepaper</title>

  <h2>Introduction To Cryptocoins and Hardware Wallets</h2>
  <p>NEO is a cryptocoin that uses 256 bit addresses (called private keys) to govern the transfer of NEO, GAS and other tokens on the NEO blockchain, by
    digitally signing the transaction that executes the transfer.
  <p>As with other cryptocoins, this means anyone that knows this 256 bit address can transfer (and thus sell) the NEO at the given address. For this
    reason, the 256 bit address must be kept in a safe place so it cannot easily be stolen. At the same time, the address must be accessible so a user can use
    it to sign transactions.
  <p>This can be done by using a piece of hardware to store the private key, and have that same hardware use the key to digitally sign transactions.
  <h2>Introduction To The Ledger Nano S</h2>
  <p>The Ledger Nano S is a device that connects to a computer's USB port and can accept data requests via USB. It has a monochrome screen with a small
    screen resolution, and two buttons at the top.
  <p>The idea is you store your private key on the hardware wallet, and then you send transactions to the hardware wallet for signing. You select 'yes' or
    'no' by pressing one of the two buttons on the top.
  <h2>Using The Ledger Nano S with NEO</h2>
  <p>There are two parts that need to be built in order to use NEO with the hardware wallet:
  <ol>
    <li>The software to run on the hardware wallet itself, to sign transactions.</li>
    <li>The software to run on the host computer, which will:
      <ol>
        <li>create the transaction</li>
        <li>send it to the hardware wallet for signing</li>
        <li>accept the wallet's decision to sign or not</li>
        <li>connect to the NEO network and send the signed transactions</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>hardware wallet software</h3>
  The hardware wallet software will allow the user to sign a transaction, or reject signing the transaction.

    <li>Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet GUI design</li>
    <li>User Workflow Diagram - What actions can the user take on each screen?
      <p>This turns out to be very simple, as the controls are limited.
      <p>The user can scroll through the below actions using the buttons, and perform an action by clicking both buttons together.
      <ol>
        <li><b>Before any action has been taken</b>, a user can exit using the left hand X. The message displayed is "Wake Up, NEO..."</li>
        <li><b>After a transaction has been sent to the ledger to be signed</b>, a user can navigate down using the left arrow, and up using the right
          arrow. clicking both buttons performs the action in brackets.</li>
        <li>Confirm a transaction and sign, without looking at the details [sign]</li>
        <li>View each output asset id, amount, and destination address [no action]</li>
        <li>View the total system fee and gas fee. [no action]</li>
        <li>Reject Transaction and do not sign. [reject]</li>
        <li>Confirm Transaction and sign. [sign]</li>
        <li>Exit</li>
      </ol>

  <h3>TestNET Client GUI in Electrum</h3>
  After that is complete, I will create a bare bones GUI in Electrum.

  <ol>
    <li>Electrum Client specific GUI design</li>
    <li>User Workflow Diagram - What actions can the user take on each screen?
      <p>Actions would be:
      <ol>
        <li>Loading the firmware onto the hardware wallet</li>
        <li>Creating a 'Send GAS' transaction for signing (done)</li>
        <li>Viewing a signed transaction before sending (done)</li>
        <li>Sending a signed transaction (done)</li>
        <li>Exit (done)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Class Diagram - What models, views, and controllers need to be made?</li>
    <li>Sequence Diagrams - When a user takes an action, what happens in the classes in the class diagram?</li>
    <li>Coding Everything</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I chose electrum because it has USB support:
